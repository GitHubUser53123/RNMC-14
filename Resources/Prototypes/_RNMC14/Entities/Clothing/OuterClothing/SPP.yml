  description: Deep modification of the standard body armor, intended for Socialist machinegunners. Contains compact fire control computers and an encrypted data processing unit in the lower back, as well as an armored cable to connect to the machine gun. Covers all requirements to operate the weapon, but a common complaint is the bulkiness.
